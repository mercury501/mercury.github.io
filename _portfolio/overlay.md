The feature consisted in a debug overlay to show various information about the player, the gameâ€™s event indexes and our own added features, and also an information overlay to show relevant values towards 100% completion.
The implementation consisted of creating fonts using the DirectX8 API and drawing text on the screen, at the end of the frame drawing pipeline.
