Being inspired by [this piece of software](https://github.com/JokieW/RandomHill) and while learning a bit of the rust language, I figured this would be the perfect project to learn and have fun with Silent Hill.

{% include gallery caption="Screenshots taken while developing the feature." %}

The tool is written completely [from scratch](https://github.com/mercury501/silent_hill_randomizer) in rust, and lets the player change the spawn odds for all the monsters in the game.
