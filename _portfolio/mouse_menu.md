I started reverse engineering Silent Hill 2â€™s cursor because of an issue (link) that asked for a way to hide the cursor while using a controller.
Since I learned how to hide the cursor, after a few seconds of inactivity, it came natural to try and enable it in menus that lacked it, namely the pause screen and the memo list screen.

{% include gallery caption="Screenshots taken while developing the feature." %}

To handle mouse interaction, I wrote a custom solution accounting for changes in game resolution, and handled interactions with the game by identifying the addresses for various indexes and updating them accordingly.
