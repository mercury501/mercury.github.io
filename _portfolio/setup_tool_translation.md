Being from Italy, and involved in the Silent Hill 2: Enhanced Edition project, I took it upon myself to translate the project's launcher tool to Italian. There are a lot of options, descriptions, and settings included in this tool, so translating everything was no quick tasks. But in doing so, it opens a large accessibility door for Italian fans and players to better enjoy the game and our project.
