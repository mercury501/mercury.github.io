Fixing 60 fps bugs for Silent Hill 2 was a multi-person effort. While this was a team effort, all of the features and fixes for 60 fps ultimately need to be coded and implemented into one source for full, proper testing. For this task, I implemented the majority of 60 fps fixes submitted to the Enhanced Edition project, as discussed here. Additionally, for those that helped with this task that aren't programming literate, I translated their pseudo code  into actual C++ fixes for the project to understand, as well. This involved reverse engineering, implementing them in code and testing.
