Hi! I'm mercury501, I like games and how they work! I'm passionate about the preservation of old games, and implementing new features.
<br>I started dabbling in reverse engineering by digging through various games' code, and learning how to manipulate and hook functions with Silent Hill 3, before starting to contribute to the [Silent Hill 2: Enhanced Edition](https://enhanced.townofsilenthill.com/SH2/) project writing a custom overlay to display debug and playthrough info, and implementing mouse input functionality for the game.
<br>I'm very passionate about games in general, most of all retro games, and I deeply care about game preservation and enhancement.
